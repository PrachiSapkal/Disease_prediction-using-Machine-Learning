# Predictive Analytics and Diagnosis for Diseases: A Machine Learning Approach
🔍 Overview
Predictive Analytics and Diagnosis for Diseases is an intelligent healthcare support system that utilizes machine learning and intuitive UI design to help users predict possible diseases based on symptoms. The system offers not only accurate predictions but also relevant remedies, enhancing early diagnosis and user awareness.

This hybrid solution integrates:

🔢 Machine Learning algorithms for disease prediction.

🖥️ A user-friendly Tkinter GUI for interaction.

🌐 A secure Node.js backend with MongoDB database for user authentication and management.

⚙️ Key Features
💡 ML-Based Predictions: Uses Random Forest Classifier and Multinomial Naive Bayes for predicting diseases.

📝 Symptom Input: Users can enter multiple symptoms through a clean GUI interface.

🩺 Remedy Suggestion: Suggests relevant remedies from a mapped Excel dataset based on the predicted disease.

🔐 Authentication System: User login and registration integrated with Node.js + MongoDB.

💬 Scalable Backend: RESTful APIs for authentication and potential future use cases (e.g., prediction history).

🎨 User-Friendly UI: Designed in Tkinter to allow access to non-technical users.

🧪 Machine Learning Pipeline
Algorithms Used:

Random Forest Classifier: Robust against overfitting and handles high-dimensional symptom data.

Multinomial Naive Bayes: Effective for categorical features like symptom presence/absence.

Dataset:

Contains a variety of symptoms and disease mappings.

Encoded using binary values (1 = symptom present, 0 = symptom absent).

Split into training/testing sets for reliable model validation.

🛠️ Tech Stack

🚀 How It Works
User Registration/Login – Authenticated via backend API with MongoDB.

Symptom Input – User selects symptoms through GUI checkboxes.

Prediction – ML model processes input and predicts the most probable disease.

Remedy Suggestion – Based on prediction, relevant remedies are fetched and shown.

 Email functionality to send prediction results.
